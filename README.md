# Small-Jobs-Django-Project
A project I began in order to exercise my back-end django skills and incorporating new things I wanted to practice. Some things include: <br/>*Using Django's RESTFUL  API to connect the back-end framework(Django) and the front-end framework(vue.js) 
<br/>*Responsive UI Design Using Bootstrap, Flexbox, and Media Queries 
<br/>*Setting up a custom User Registration/Login template
<br/>*First time using the Google Maps API
<br/>
<br/>
Learned a lot although I could have made the UI look better. I am expecting my next project to have a larger scope and will put more effort into the UI as I learn more about Django.

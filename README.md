# Small-Jobs-Django-Project
A project I began in order to exercise my back-end django skills and incorporating new things I wanted to practice. Some things include: <br/>*Using Django's RESTFUL  API to connect the back-end framework(Django) and the front-end framework(vue.js) 
<br/>*Responsive UI Design Using Bootstrap, Flexbox, and Media Queries 
<br/>*Setting up a custom User Registration/Login template
<br/>*Getting more used to the database structure such as using ForeignKeys and understanding migrations
<br/>*First time using the Google Maps API
<br/> <b>SOME FUNCTIONALITY <b>  
<ul>  
  <li>User Registration</li>
  <li>Media Uploads</li>
  <li>Job Creation by User</li>
  <li>Job Detail with User info(listing other jobs by that user)</li>
</ul>
<br/>

Learned a lot although I could have made the UI look better. I am expecting my next project to have a larger scope and will put more effort into the UI as I learn more about Django.
